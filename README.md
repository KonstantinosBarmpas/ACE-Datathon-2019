## Structure

In November 2019, I participated in the ACE Datathon 2019 by ETH Data Analytics Club [[Analytics_Club_ETH](https://analytics-club.org/)] in the classification challenge. The repo contains my presentation slides and the code (Jupyter notebook) with the model. No training data has been shared in this repo.

## How to run

This repo contains mainly Jupyter notebook files which can be run after installing Jupyter Notebook. Run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

`pip install notebook`
